//First launch the simulator, planner and rviz visualization each in it`s own terminal
roslaunch ur10.launch
roslaunch ur10_moveit_planning_execution.launch
roslaunch moveit_rviz.launch

//Then launch the ur_sim node
roslaunch ur_sim.launch



//You can write a bash script for delayed launching of the files, but the ur10.launch often fails, so I wouldn`t recommend it.
